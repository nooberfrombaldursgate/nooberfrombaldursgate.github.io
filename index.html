          <p>
            LOUISVILLE, Ky. — A grand jury weighing evidence in one of the
            country’s most contentious police shootings indicted a former
            Louisville police detective on charges of reckless endangerment on
            Wednesday for his role in the raid on the home of Breonna Taylor,
            but the two officers who shot Ms. Taylor six times faced no charges.
          </p>

          <p>
            Protesters poured into the streets in Louisville after the
            announcement, and at least two police officers were shot shortly
            before a 9 p.m. curfew. There were also demonstrations in New York,
            Chicago, Milwaukee and smaller cities around the country.
          </p>

          <p>
            The demonstrators called for all three officers, who are white, to
            be held to account for Ms. Taylor’s death in March. The officers had
            fired a total of 32 shots after they stormed her apartment with a
            warrant.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prosecutors found that the two officers who shot Ms. Taylor, who was
            Black, were justified in their use of force because they had
            identified themselves as officers and had then come under fire from
            her boyfriend, who said he thought it was intruders forcing their
            way inside. The charges against former Detective Brett Hankison were
            for firing recklessly into a neighbor’s apartment.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ms. Taylor’s death, which came months before George Floyd was killed
            by the Minneapolis police, became a rallying cry for racial justice
            protesters nationwide. On Wednesday afternoon, hundreds of
            demonstrators chanted Breonna Taylor’s name between sobs and scowls
            as they wound their way through the streets of Louisville. They
            carried signs that said “abolish police” and “Black lives matter.”
            Dozens of cars followed, honking their horns.
          </p>

          <p>
            For more than two hours, the police followed in silver cruisers
            without intervening. But eventually a line of officers in riot gear
            confronted protesters, released chemical agents and arrested several
            people in the crowd.

          <p>
            At a news conference on Wednesday in Frankfort, Kentucky’s attorney
            general, Daniel Cameron, walked through the grand jury’s decision in
            detail in an effort to defuse the rage.
          </p>

          <p>
            “The decision before my office is not to decide if the loss of
            Breonna Taylor’s life was a tragedy — the answer to that question is
            unequivocally yes,” he said.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mr. Cameron, a Republican, acknowledged that not everyone would be
            satisfied with the charges and said that as a Black man, he
            understood the pain that was brought about by Ms. Taylor’s death.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Justice is not often easy and does not fit the mold of public
            opinion. And it does not conform to shifting standards,” Mr. Cameron
            said.
          </p>

          <p>
            The grand jury decision to indict Mr. Hankison came after more than
            100 days of protests on the streets of Louisville and after a
            monthslong investigation into the death of Ms. Taylor, a 26-year-old
            emergency room technician who was shot in the hallway of her
            apartment by officers executing a search warrant as part of a drug
            investigation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Grand jurors indicted Mr. Hankison, a detective at the time, on
            three counts of “wanton endangerment,” saying he had imperiled the
            lives of three of Ms. Taylor’s neighbors by firing bullets that
            reached their apartment.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mr. Hankison fired through a door and window of Ms. Taylor’s
            apartment building that were covered with blinds, violating a
            department policy that requires officers to have a line of sight. At
            least some of his rounds reached the apartment directly behind Ms.
            Taylor’s, where a pregnant woman, her husband and their 5-year-old
            child were asleep. The rounds shattered the family’s glass door but
            did not harm anyone.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mr. Hankison is the only one of the three officers who fired their
            weapons who was dismissed from the force, with a termination letter
            stating that he showed “an extreme indifference to the value of
            human life.”
          </p>

          <p>
            All summer across America, Ms. Taylor’s name has been chanted and
            her image held up on posters at rallies protesting police brutality,
            with celebrities writing open letters and erecting billboards that
            demanded the officers be criminally charged.
          </p>

          <p>
            In anticipation of the grand jury’s decision, the Louisville Metro
            Police Department canceled vacations and Chief Robert J. Schroeder
            said officers would not be granted time off. A local judge signed an
            order shutting the federal courthouse downtown, where storefronts
            and office towers were boarded up because of demonstrations that
            sometimes turned violent.
          </p>

          <p>
            The concern about further unrest appeared prescient after two police
            officers were shot on Wednesday night. In a video livestreamed by
            the department, officers fired several projectiles while marching
            south along Brook Street. Moments later, several other bangs were
            heard, and the officers scattered. “Shots fired, shots fired,” said
            the woman recording the video as she ran for cover. Officers took
            cover behind a police truck and began shouting “officer down!”
          </p>

          <p>
            Robert J. Schroeder, the Louisville police chief, said at a brief
            news conference that a suspect was in custody and that neither of
            the officers’ injuries were life-threatening.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tensions boiled over at several protests nationwide. In Buffalo, a
            truck drove through a group of people who had gathered to protest,
            according to a local reporter at the scene. Demonstrators blocked
            highway traffic in Milwaukee, and protesters who marched from
            Brooklyn into the Lower East Side of Manhattan yelled at patrons in
            restaurants: “Wake up, this is your fight too!”
          </p>

        <div class="body-text-container">
          <p>
            Earlier Wednesday in downtown Louisville, crowds who had gathered to
            listen as the indictment was read aloud cried out in fury and grief.
          </p>

          <p>
            After the announcement, protesters shrieked in disgust. Shouts of
            “That’s it?” rose from the crowd. One person called for the city to
            be burned down. Several people broke down in sobs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Desaray Yarbrough, who walked out of her Louisville house as people
            in the crowd marched past it, said the announcement would do nothing
            to quell angry demonstrators.
          </p>

          <p>
            “It’s unjustifiable,” Ms. Yarbrough said. “The lack of charges is
            getting ready to bring the city down.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Ms. Taylor’s mother, who had sued the city of Louisville for
            wrongful death in April, received a $12 million settlement last
            week. But Ben Crump, a lawyer for the family, wrote on Twitter that
            the lack of additional charges was “outrageous and offensive.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Many legal experts had predicted that indictments would be unlikely,
            given that a state statute in Kentucky allowed citizens to use
            lethal force in self-defense and that it was Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend
            who had fired first.
          </p>

          <p>
            “As an African-American, as someone who has been victim of police
            misconduct myself, getting pulled over and profiled, I know how
            people feel,” said John W. Stewart, a former assistant attorney
            general in Kentucky. “I have been there, but I have also been a
            prosecutor, and emotions cannot play a part here.”
          </p>

          <p>
            During the raid, two officers, Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly and Detective
            Myles Cosgrove, returned fire after Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth
            Walker, fired one shot that struck Sergeant Mattingly in the leg,
            Mr. Cameron said. Mr. Walker’s bullet pierced Sergeant Mattingly’s
            femoral artery, and officers scrambled to apply a tourniquet to his
            leg.
          </p>

          <p>
            The officers who broke down Ms. Taylor’s door shortly after midnight
            on March 13 had come with a search warrant, signed by a local
            magistrate. They had court approval for a “no-knock” warrant, which
            Louisville has since banned, but the orders were changed before the
            raid, requiring them to knock first and announce themselves as the
            police.

            Mr. Walker has said that he and Ms. Taylor did not know who was at
            her door. Only one neighbor, out of nearly a dozen interviewed by
            The New York Times, reported hearing the officers shout “police”

            The warrant for Ms. Taylor’s apartment was one of five issued in a
            case involving her ex-boyfriend Jamarcus Glover, who is accused of
            running a drug trafficking syndicate. At the other addresses that
            were searched, officers found a table covered in drugs packaged for
            sale, including a plastic sachet containing cocaine and fentanyl,
            police logs and a laboratory report show.
          </p>

          <p>
            The surveillance leading police officers to Ms. Taylor’s home
            included a GPS tracker showing repeated trips by Mr. Glover to her
            home; photographs of him emerging from her apartment with a package
            in his hands; footage showing her in a car with Mr. Glover arriving
            at one of the trap houses he operated; and his use of her address on
            bank records and other documents. The F.B.I. has opened an
            investigation into whether the inclusion of her name and address on
            the warrant violated her civil rights, as her family’s lawyers have
            claimed.
          </p>

          <p>
            The announcement on Wednesday revealed several new details in the
            case. Investigators at an F.B.I. laboratory reviewed the ballistics
            evidence and concluded that the shot that killed Ms. Taylor was
            fired by Detective Cosgrove. A total of 32 shots were fired by the
            police: 16 by Detective Cosgrove, 10 by Mr. Hankison and six by
            Sergeant Mattingly. The attorney general said none of Mr. Hankison’s
            rounds struck Ms. Taylor.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mr. Cameron, who ran on a law-and-order platform, said the
            investigation and the grand jury determined that the police had
            properly knocked and announced their presence before bursting into
            Ms. Taylor’s apartment — a point disputed by Mr. Walker and by a
            number of neighbors who have said in interviews with reporters that
            they heard no announcement.
          </p>

          <p>
            For months, Ms. Taylor’s death has been a rallying cry. Michelle
            Obama and Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee,
            called out her name during the Democratic National Convention. Oprah
            Winfrey paid for billboards demanding the officers be charged,
            writing in her magazine, “We have to use whatever megaphone we can.”

        <div class="body-text-container">
          <p>
            Joseph R. Biden Jr. was trying to demonstrate the lasting power of the federal judiciary. So he did the
            math.
          </p>

          <p>
            Addressing a Michigan law school audience in April 1991, then-Senator Biden said that if trends in life
            expectancy held, a justice freshly confirmed around that time would “be making landmark decisions in the
            year
            2020.”
          </p>

          <p>
            “I’ll be dead and gone, in all probability,” Mr. Biden told the crowd.
          </p>

          <p>
            He was half right.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nearly three decades later, the man whom the Senate confirmed that year, Justice Clarence Thomas, is still
            rendering decisions — the eldest jurist, if President Trump has his way, of a soon-to-be 6-to-3 conservative
            majority.
          </p>

          <p>
            But Mr. Biden is indeed alive, left to consider what the court’s emerging tilt would mean for the Democratic
            agenda if he wins the White House — and for his own attachment to the Capitol’s bygone harmony and mores.
          </p>

        </div>

        <blockquote>
          <div class="quote-container">

          </div>
        </blockquote>

        <div class="body-text-container">
          <p>
            After a half-century in public life, with a lead role in several indelible confirmation dramas through the
            years, Mr. Biden could, if elected, be saddled with a Supreme Court primed to counteract his policy aims on
            health care, abortion and other defining issues.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many Democrats now believe that adding seats to the court is the urgent remedy, an extraordinary step that
            has
            not been seriously contemplated since the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt. They argue that the
            court’s
            legitimacy has already eroded amid the Republican confirmation maneuvers of the last four years.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet for Mr. Biden, a proud man of the Senate, such an effort would amount to the sort of norm-razing
            exercise
            that might strike him as an escalation too many.
          </p>

          <p>
            “My inclination is to think that he would just see that as making it more political instead of making it
            less
            political,” said Cynthia C. Hogan, a former Judiciary Committee aide who helped lead Mr. Biden’s search for
            a
            2020 running mate. “I think he wants to restore the court to its earlier place of respect.”
          </p>

          <p>
            In the immediate term, the court has unavoidably moved to the center of the campaign, with Mr. Trump’s
            expected announcement on Saturday that he is nominating Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a favorite of
            conservatives,
            to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the stalwart liberal who died last week.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the judiciary is a subject with which Mr. Biden is intimately familiar — perhaps more so than any modern
            nominee — it is also one that he has largely avoided in the presidential race, preferring to focus on the
            calamitous federal response to the coronavirus pandemic and the perpetual volatility of Mr. Trump’s rule.
          </p>

          <p>
            The broader irony is not lost on Mr. Biden’s allies: He is, at present, effectively powerless to stop the
            ideological drift of a court wrenched to the right by a president who ran casinos when Mr. Biden ran the
            Senate Judiciary Committee.
          </p>

          <p>
            And even if Mr. Biden is elected, his institutionalist bearing might preclude his support for a possible
            workaround.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interviews with more than a dozen former colleagues, aides and other contemporaries from his earlier court
            clashes present Mr. Biden as a conflicted combatant in the judicial trenches, negotiating the constant tug
            between precedent and pragmatism, convention and conviction.
          </p>

          <p>
            During the Democratic primaries last year, as activists pressed him to embrace the court expansion
            proposals,
            Mr. Biden dismissed the idea out of hand, predicting that “we’ll live to rue that day.” But he has recently
            taken a more ambivalent stance.
          </p>

          <p>
            “It’s a legitimate question,” Mr. Biden said in a television interview this week. He also declined to answer
            it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even before he got to Washington as a 30-year-old senator, Mr. Biden had his eye on the Judiciary Committee.
          </p>

          <p>
            And the road there ran through Senator James O. Eastland, a segregationist from Mississippi.

          <p>
            Mr. Eastland “was probably as far apart from me on civil rights as any man in the Senate," Mr. Biden wrote
            in
            his 2007 memoir, “but he was also the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, a committee that handled all
            crime
            legislation, a committee on which I badly wanted to serve.”
          </p>

          <p>
            They built a relationship, Mr. Biden said, and Mr. Eastland awarded him a spot at the end of his first term.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the decades that followed, Mr. Biden’s time on the committee doubled as a kind of working history of the
            Supreme Court confirmation process’s lurch from collaborative to cantankerous — a trajectory Mr. Biden
            helped
            chart, sometimes assertively and sometimes reluctantly, and sometimes more by accident and error than
            considered strategy.
          </p>

          <p>
            He was there in 1986 for the 98-0 confirmation of Justice Antonin Scalia, falling in line despite the
            nominee’s sharp conservative views, and for the non-confirmation of Judge Merrick B. Garland three decades
            later, as the vice president in an administration blocked from filling the vacancy left by Justice Scalia’s
            death.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mr. Biden was there, as chairman by 1987, to thwart the nomination of the firebrand conservative Robert H.
            Bork, the first modern rejection of a nominee for principally ideological reasons.
          </p>

          <p>
            And he was there to preside over the Thomas hearings, during which the committee’s treatment of Anita Hill,
            who accused the judge of sexual harassment, became an enduring mark on Mr. Biden’s Senate legacy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Former aides and colleagues on the committee describe Mr. Biden as keenly attuned to Senate custom and
            determined to uphold a culture of collegiality — one that encouraged warm relations between Democrats like
            him
            and right-wing figures like Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who led the panel for much of the 1980s.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mr. Biden, the top Democrat on the committee at the time, participated in a few preliminary skirmishes in
            that
            period, including one that ended in the defeat of an Alabama district court nominee named Jeff Sessions. And
            Justice Scalia’s landslide confirmation is best viewed in the context of a simultaneous fight Democrats
            picked
            with another judge, William H. Rehnquist, whom President Ronald Reagan hoped to elevate to chief justice.
            Mr.
            Biden joined 32 senators in futile opposition.
          </p>

          <p>
            But any tussle then seemed to register as a one-off, rarely tethered to any broader interparty antagonism.

            “The confirmation battles of the time were nominee-specific,” said Neal S. Manne, who served in the 1980s as
            chief counsel to the Judiciary Committee when it was controlled by Republicans. “They weren’t really viewed
            as
            some sort of skirmish in a larger war for the political soul of the judiciary.”
          </p>

          <p>
            They also were not necessarily required viewing.
          </p>

          <p>
            For most of the decade, Mr. Manne said, “nobody came to the hearings; everybody got confirmed.”

            Laurence H. Tribe, the Harvard Law School professor who helped prepare Mr. Biden for the Bork hearings, said
            Mr. Biden had tended to resist pressure to subject nominees to explicit partisan screening, even after the
            process had grown more openly ideological.
          </p>

          <p>
            “I don’t think he ever came close to articulating a ‘Biden test’ for what’s acceptable,” Mr. Tribe said.
            But,
            he added, Mr. Biden was concerned about nominees who would lead to the court’s “being way out of kilter and
            out of sync with the country as a whole.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Robert Bork was one such nominee. Shortly before his nomination, Mr. Biden had suggested in a newspaper
            interview that he would most likely support such a choice because of Judge Bork’s formidable legal
            credentials. “I’m not Teddy Kennedy,” he told The Philadelphia Inquirer, suggesting that he was no fiery
            progressive.

            Mr. Biden quickly shed that stance, arguing instead that the judge’s positions on civil rights,
            contraception
            and the right to privacy placed him far outside the mainstream.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a speech on the Senate floor in July 1987, Mr. Biden insisted that ideology was fair game when the
            overall
            balance of the court was at stake. Part of the Senate’s role, he argued, was not merely reviewing a
            nominee’s
            background but also “preventing the president from undermining judicial independence and remaking the court
            in
            his own image.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Aides and peers, including some of the six Republicans who joined him in opposing Judge Bork, credited Mr.
            Biden
            with synthesizing byzantine legal concepts into digestible arguments against the nominee in public hearings.
            Judge Bork’s defeat was also something of a personal redemption arc for Mr. Biden, whose first presidential
            run
            had collapsed weeks earlier amid allegations of plagiarism.
          </p>

          <p>
            While some Republicans have not forgiven Mr. Biden, enshrining “Bork” as a verb for the unduly railroaded,
            any
            acrimony within the Senate itself was short-lived during his chairmanship.
          </p>

          <p>
            The 2020 Democratic nominee who still often interrupts himself to raise a “point of personal privilege” was
            known especially for his attention to detail.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thomas D. Rath, the former attorney general of New Hampshire who assisted in the confirmation process of
            Justice
            David H. Souter, recalled Mr. Biden’s going “out of his way to be gentlemanly” to the Souter team.
          </p>

          <p>
            “He provided a staff room we could be in during breaks, made sure of things like the judge had water, all
            the
            nice little things you do,” Mr. Rath said. “He really had a very proper tone to it.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Biden allies have suggested that his lowest moment on the committee — overseeing the Thomas hearings, in
            which
            Ms. Hill was subjected to invasive and demeaning questions from Republicans — owed largely to the same
            impulse:
            prizing Senate decorum in a moment when regular order seemed to have little meaning.
          </p>

          <p>
            But if Mr. Biden hoped to earn a measure of appreciation from Republicans, he appeared to succeed.
          </p>

          <p>
            “He just had a very, very difficult situation,” said former Senator John Danforth, a Missouri Republican who
            championed Justice Thomas’s nomination. “And he was trying to manage it to the best of his ability.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite any lingering passions from the Bork and Thomas hearings, Mr. Biden’s time as chairman more often
            featured largely incident-free confirmations, under Republican and Democratic administrations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Justice Anthony M. Kennedy was confirmed without a dissenting vote. Justice Souter won approval, 90-9, with
            Mr.
            Biden’s support, which found him splitting with some liberal senators like Ted Kennedy and John Kerry.
            Justice
            Ginsburg and Justice Stephen G. Breyer likewise earned lopsided votes.

            As in his Senate life, the Joe Biden of 2020 is no Democrat’s idea of a radical.
          </p>

          <p>
            But that he would even publicly entertain the idea of adding justices as “legitimate” is a telling signal of
            how
            far his thinking has traveled — and of how far the Senate has, if even Mr. Biden seems to doubt that the
            present
            rancor can be transcended by sheer force of compromise.
          </p>

          <p>
            “He’s disappointed in a lot of the people in the Senate now and a lot of the people he knew — or thought he
            knew,” said Mike Gelacak, a former aide who has known Mr. Biden since law school. “I think he has a hard
            time
            relating to it because that’s not the way he operated, and it’s not the way it used to be done. It’s a

            place.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Mr. Biden’s deference to cooler-heads-prevail thinking seemed to persist even as quarrels over the courts
            grew
            more vitriolic and ideological, with Democratic efforts to block the appellate court nominees of President
            George W. Bush and the Republican obstruction of President Barack Obama’s selections.

        <div class="body-text-container">
          <p>
            The battle over Judge Garland was a climactic encapsulation of the push and pull of judicial politics that
            has
            buffeted Mr. Biden throughout his career. In promoting the nomination as vice president, Mr. Biden hailed it
            as
            “the course of moderation” — the sensible option in a divided government. Stonewalling Republicans, Mr.
            Biden
            said, risked damaging “the bonds that held our diverse republic together for the last 229 years.”
          </p>

          <p>
            They were unpersuaded.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some Democrats have questioned whether the good will Mr. Biden sought from Republicans over the years did
            him
            much good in the long run, given his opponents’ slashing approach to the judiciary over the last decade.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Unfortunately, I think he has been a little too slow,” said Jim Manley, a former aide to Mr. Kennedy and to
            Harry Reid, the former majority leader. “The idea that you can cut a deal with Mitch McConnell is just not
            accurate.”
          </p>

          <p>
            If Mr. Biden has reached the same conclusion, he will be left to weigh whether there is any alternative to
            the
            current state of affairs besides total and ever-escalating warfare in the Senate and on the bench.
          </p>

          <p>
            Former Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who served with Mr. Biden and described having
            institutionalist instincts in the Senate, said that she had come to believe that adding court seats should
            be
            explored.
          </p>

          <p>
            “If you look over history, they’ve changed the number of justices many times,” she said. “It should be on
            the
            table.”
          </p>

          <p>
            For Mr. Biden, pursuing that course would be a kind of admission that the glad-handing Senate experiences he
            holds dear (and cites often) are no longer particularly relevant.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2016, as he pleaded with Republicans to give Judge Garland a fair hearing, Mr. Biden told a law school
            audience in Washington that he had helped shepherd more Supreme Court confirmations than “anyone alive.”
          </p>


          <p>
            “Ohhh,” Mr. Biden said, faux-exasperated, shaking his head and making the sign of the cross. “I can’t be
            that
            old.”

          <p>
            Ruth Bader Ginsburg became, late in her long and illustrious career, more than just a Supreme Court justice.
            She was a cultural symbol, a human distillation of an era and a cause, her special celebrity rooted in the
            way
            her fight for legal opportunities for women combined with her own extraordinary success in the spheres she
            opened up. As a jurist Ginsburg was one of the court’s four liberals, important but not singular; as the
            Notorious R.B.G., she embodied liberal feminism, a history of struggle and achievement condensed into three
            initials and one life.
          </p>

          <p>
            Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump’s choice to take her seat, is a signifier of a different sort. In her
            combination of elite accomplishment with a faith and a family life that’s unusual among her high-achieving
            peers, what she condenses isn’t the recent history of feminism but a question that its success has created:
            Namely, can there be a conservative feminism that’s distinctive, coherent and influential, at least beyond
            quirky religious subcultures like the faculty at the University of Notre Dame?
          </p>

          <p>
            By conservative feminism I mean something different from 1970s-era female resistance to the women’s
            movement,
            whether in its arch Joan Didion form or its mass-movement Phyllis Schlafly incarnation. Schlafly’s
            anti-feminism, the core women’s conservatism of the ’70s, argued that the push for female advancement was
            either unnecessary or destructive, that it gave women things they didn’t really need and it took from them —
            from mothers, especially — protections that they relied upon. Its icon was the beleaguered homemaker; the
            fact
            that Schlafly was herself such a vigorously public figure didn’t change her fundamental identity as a
            defender
            of the domestic sphere.
          </p>

          <p>
            A conservative feminism today, on the other hand — again, if we can say that it exists — is adaptive rather
            than oppositional. It takes for granted that much of what Ginsburg fought for was necessary and just; that
            the
            old order suppressed female talent and ambition; that sexism and misogyny are more potent forces than many
            anti-feminists allowed. It agrees that the accomplishments of Barrett’s career — in academia and now on the
            federal bench — could have been denied to her in 1950, and it hails that change as good.
          </p>

          <p>
            But then it also argues that feminism’s victories were somewhat unbalanced, that they were kinder to
            professional ambition than to other human aspirations, and that the society they forged has lost its
            equilibrium not just in work-life balance but also in other areas — sex and romance and marriage and child
            rearing, with the sexes increasingly alienated from one another and too many children desired but never
            born.
          </p>

          <p>
            This diagnosis is not necessarily conservative; some of it might be endorsed by more radical feminists, for
            whom the alienation and disappointment is proof that enduring features of patriarchy and capitalism still
            need
            to be abolished.
          </p>

          <p>
            The conservative prescription, though, is not to march deeper into Marx or Judith Butler but to integrate
            feminist insights with ideas from the old regime about the centrality of marriage, children and religious
            commitment to the good life.
          </p>

          <p>
            This attempted integration doesn’t have a single dominant theorist — its theorizing probably peaked in the
            1990s with writers like Barbara Dafoe Whitehead — but it has many American embodiments: professional women
            across the country (and, by extension, many husbands in their dual-earner homes) whose life courses
            generally
            resemble the rest of their class, but with certain choices that seem somewhat more eccentric or askew. That
            means shorter dating lives and earlier marriages, four or five children instead of two or fewer, and other
            more traditionally coded choices — more frequent churchgoing, denser social networks, living closer to
            extended family, work lives designed more around home life than the reverse.
          </p>

          <p>
            By comparison with the average educated women’s life trajectory 80 years ago, these women look like Ruth
            Bader
            Ginsburg’s heirs. By comparison to the most prominent contemporary avatars of liberal feminism, however —
            including Ginsburg’s fellow female justices and the Democratic nominee for vice president — they look
            somewhat
            more like Amy Coney Barrett, even if the size of her family and the scale of her professional success make
            her
            an outlier in almost any company.
          </p>

          <p>
            This means that, if elevated to the Supreme Court, she will probably enjoy more celebrity than the typical
            justice. She’ll be more of an R.B.G.-style cultural symbol — as A.C.B., Glorious or Notorious — with her own
            distinctive, if considerably smaller fan base, plus a certain type of critic who regards her fecundity as
            threatening or irresponsible, her claim to any kind of feminism a cheat. (Obviously if she plays a role in
            changing the court’s abortion jurisprudence, the latter antagonism will be sharpened.)
          </p>

          <p>
            This is a substantial burden to impose on any public figure, let alone a mom with teenagers, and for
            conservatives who are ready to put her initials on a bumper sticker, two cautions are in order. First, human
            beings don’t always bear the weight that identity politics imposes on them, something that’s all-too-clear
            from the arc of the last great female conservative hope, a certain erstwhile Alaska governor.
          </p>

          <p>
            Second, one reason that conservative feminism as I’ve described it doesn’t play a substantial role in our
            politics right now is that it hasn’t been distilled into a compelling policy agenda — pro-woman, pro-mother,
            pro-work-life-balance — by our increasingly male-dominated conservative party. (Another reason, of course,
            is
            that this party is led by Donald Trump.)
          </p>

          <p>
            There are efforts to change this, including an interesting conservative attempt to draw on the work of
            Elizabeth Warren from her pre-Senate, more right-of-center days, but they haven’t come to fruition. And an
            originalist justice with a limited view of the judiciary’s ambit, which is what Barrett promises to be, is
            probably not going to be the leader that this effort needs, however much her personal story seems to embody
            its purposes.
          </p>
